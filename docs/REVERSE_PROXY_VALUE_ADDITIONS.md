# Value-Adding Ideas for Prox: Solving Major Reverse Proxy Problems

This document outlines current major problems with reverse proxies and proposes solutions or features that Prox can implement to add significant value.

---

## 1. Dynamic Configuration Reloading ✅ (Implemented)
**Problem:** Most reverse proxies require a restart to reload configuration changes, causing downtime or dropped connections.

**Solution:** *Already implemented in Prox.*
- Prox uses a file watcher to detect changes to the configuration file and reloads the configuration at runtime, without requiring a server restart. This ensures zero-downtime updates to routes, certificates, and rate limits.

---

## 2. Fine-Grained Observability & Analytics
**Problem:** Limited built-in metrics, logging, and tracing in many proxies. External tools are often required.

**Solution:**
- Integrate structured logging (JSON, log levels).
- Expose Prometheus metrics (requests, errors, latency, backend health).
- Add distributed tracing support (OpenTelemetry).
- Provide a simple dashboard or API for real-time stats.

## 3. Advanced Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention ✅ (Implemented)
**Problem:** Many proxies offer only basic rate limiting (by IP). More advanced, flexible controls are often needed.

**Solution:** *Already implemented in Prox.*
- Supports rate limiting by IP, header, or route-wide, with configurable limits and responses.
- Multiple algorithms (Token Bucket, Fixed Window, Sliding Window).
- Custom responses and missing key policies.

---

## 4. Automatic TLS Certificate Management ✅ (Implemented)
**Problem:** Manual certificate management is error-prone and not scalable.

**Solution:** *Fully implemented in Prox.*
- Prox supports TLS with user-provided certificates (see README for setup).
- **NEW**: Automatic certificate provisioning/renewal using ACME/Let's Encrypt is now fully implemented.
- Supports both staging and production Let's Encrypt environments.
- Automatic daily certificate renewal checks.
- HTTP-01 challenge validation.
- Configurable storage paths and renewal thresholds.

---

## 5. Zero-Downtime Deployments & Graceful Restarts
**Problem:** Restarts can drop connections or cause brief outages.

**Solution:**
- Implement graceful shutdown and restart logic.
- Allow seamless binary upgrades (e.g., via socket passing).

*Status: Planned*

---

## 6. Pluggable Authentication & Authorization
**Problem:** Authentication is often left to upstream services, leading to duplicated logic.

**Solution:**
- Provide built-in support for JWT, OAuth2, API keys, and mTLS.
- Allow custom authentication plugins (Rust trait-based).
- Route-based access control policies.

*Status: Planned*

---

## 7. Dynamic Service Discovery & Health Checking ✅ (Health Checking Implemented)
**Problem:** Static backend lists are inflexible; many proxies lack robust health checks.

**Solution:**
- Prox implements periodic health checks for backend services, with configurable intervals, thresholds, and custom endpoints.
- Service discovery (Consul, etcd, DNS-SRV) is *planned*.

---

## 8. Modern Protocol Support
**Problem:** Limited support for HTTP/2, HTTP/3, and WebSockets in some proxies.

**Solution:**
- Add first-class support for HTTP/2, HTTP/3 (QUIC), and WebSockets.
- Allow protocol upgrades and streaming.

*Status: Planned*

---

## 9. Developer Experience & Extensibility
**Problem:** Difficult to extend or customize logic in many proxies.

**Solution:**
- Expose plugin system (Rust traits, WASM, or scripting).
- Provide clear API for custom middleware (logging, auth, transforms).
- Excellent documentation and examples.

*Status: Planned*

---

## 10. Security Features
**Problem:** Many proxies lack built-in security hardening.

**Solution:**
- Add DDoS protection (connection limits, slowloris mitigation).
- Built-in WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules.
- Automatic HTTP header hardening (HSTS, CSP, etc.).
- Rate limit or block based on geolocation or ASN.

*Status: Planned*

---

## 11. Configuration Validation & Error Reporting
**Problem:** Misconfigurations can cause silent failures or downtime.

**Solution:**
- Implement schema validation for YAML config.
- Provide clear, actionable error messages.
- Optionally, a web UI for config editing and validation.

*Status: Planned*

---

## 12. Edge Caching
**Problem:** No built-in caching in many lightweight proxies.

**Solution:**
- Add simple, configurable response caching (per route, per backend).
- Support cache invalidation and cache-control headers.

*Status: Planned*

---

## 13. Multi-Tenancy & Namespacing
**Problem:** Difficult to isolate routes/backends for different teams or customers.

**Solution:**
- Support for namespaced configs, per-tenant rate limits, and access controls.

*Status: Planned*

---

## 14. Easy Local Development & Testing
**Problem:** Hard to run and test proxies locally with realistic features.

**Solution:**
- Provide a "dev mode" with hot reload, mock backends, and verbose logging.
- CLI tools for config validation and test traffic generation.

*Status: Planned*

---

## 15. Cloud-Native Integrations
**Problem:** Not all proxies are easy to run in Kubernetes or cloud environments.

**Solution:**
- Provide Helm charts, K8s CRDs, and sidecar mode.
- Integrate with cloud-native service meshes.

*Status: Planned*
