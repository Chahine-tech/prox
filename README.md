# Prox: A Lightweight Reverse Proxy with Hexagonal Architecture

Prox is a lightweight reverse proxy built in Rust, implementing a hexagonal architecture (also known as ports and adapters architecture) for maintainability, testability, and flexibility.

## Features

- HTTP/HTTPS support with TLS
- Static file serving
- HTTP redirects
- Load balancing (round-robin and random strategies)
- Path Rewriting for proxy and load-balanced routes
- Health checking for backend services
- Rate limiting (by IP, header, or route-wide) with configurable limits and responses
- Configurable via YAML
- Custom error handling with type safety
- Browser-like request headers for improved compatibility
- Request and Response Manipulation (Headers & Body) with conditional logic.

## Architecture

Prox follows a hexagonal architecture pattern, which separates the application into three main areas:

1. **Core Domain** - Contains the business logic of the application
2. **Ports** - Interfaces that define how the core interacts with the outside world
3. **Adapters** - Implementations of the ports that connect to external systems

### Benefits of Hexagonal Architecture

1. **Testability**: Core domain logic can be tested independently of HTTP, file systems, etc.
2. **Flexibility**: Components can be replaced without affecting the rest of the system
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clean boundaries between different parts of the application
4. **Domain Focus**: Business logic is isolated from technical details


## Usage

## Usage

### Option 1: Manual TLS Certificates

1. Generate self-signed certificates for HTTPS (or use your own):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p certs
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=localhost'
   ```

2. Configure your reverse proxy in `config.yaml` with manual certificates

3. Run the proxy: `cargo run`

### Option 2: Automatic TLS with Let's Encrypt (ACME)

1. Configure your reverse proxy in `config.yaml` with ACME settings

2. Ensure your domain points to your server and port 443 is accessible

3. Run the proxy: `cargo run`

**Note**: For ACME to work, your server must be publicly accessible on port 443, and the domains you specify must point to your server for HTTP-01 challenge validation.

## Configuration Examples

### Manual TLS Configuration

```yaml
listen_addr: "0.0.0.0:443"
# Manual TLS configuration
tls:
  cert_path: "./certs/cert.pem"
  key_path: "./certs/key.pem"

# Health check configuration
health_check:
  enabled: true
  interval_secs: 10
  timeout_secs: 5
  path: "/health"
  unhealthy_threshold: 3
  healthy_threshold: 2
```

### Automatic TLS with ACME/Let's Encrypt

## ACME Configuration Options

When using automatic TLS certificate management with ACME (Let's Encrypt), you can configure the following options:

- **`enabled`**: Set to `true` to enable ACME certificate management
- **`domains`**: List of domains to include in the certificate (first domain is the primary)
- **`email`**: Contact email for Let's Encrypt account registration
- **`staging`**: Set to `true` to use Let's Encrypt staging environment for testing (optional, defaults to `false`)
- **`ca_url`**: Custom ACME CA URL (optional, defaults to Let's Encrypt production)
- **`storage_path`**: Directory to store certificates and account data (optional, defaults to `./acme_storage`)
- **`renewal_days_before_expiry`**: Days before expiry to renew certificates (optional, defaults to 30)

### ACME Requirements

1. **Public accessibility**: Your server must be publicly accessible on port 443
2. **Domain DNS**: All domains in your configuration must point to your server's IP address
3. **HTTP-01 challenge**: Prox automatically handles HTTP-01 challenges by serving files from `./static/.well-known/acme-challenge/`

### ACME Certificate Renewal

- Certificates are automatically checked daily for renewal
- Renewal occurs when the certificate expires within the configured threshold (default: 30 days)
- The renewal process runs in the background without interrupting service

## Testing

You can test the proxy using curl:

```bash
# Test static content
curl -k https://127.0.0.1:3000/static

# Test redirection
curl -k -L https://127.0.0.1:3000/

# Test proxy
curl -k https://127.0.0.1:3000/proxy/get

# Test proxy with path rewriting
curl -k https://127.0.0.1:3000/proxy/test/path # Assuming /proxy has path_rewrite: "/anything"
# Expected: httpbin.org receives a request for /anything/test/path

# Test request header addition (X-My-Custom-Header: MyValue)
curl -k -H "X-My-Custom-Header: OriginalValue" https://127.0.0.1:3000/proxy/headers -v
# Expected: Prox adds/overwrites X-My-Custom-Header, removes User-Agent, adds X-Real-IP

# Test request body modification (POST to /proxy/special/anything)
# This will trigger the request_body.set_text action due to path_matches: "/special"
curl -k -X POST -d '{"original": "data"}' https://127.0.0.1:3000/proxy/special/post -H "Content-Type: application/json"
# Expected: httpbin.org receives "This is a modified request body."

# Test response header removal (X-Powered-By) and addition (Server: Prox)
curl -k -I https://127.0.0.1:3000/proxy/get
# Expected: X-Powered-By header (if present from httpbin) is removed, Server: Prox is added.

# Test load balancing (run multiple times to see round-robin in action)
curl -k https://127.0.0.1:3000/balance/get
```

Note: The `-k` flag is used to skip certificate validation for self-signed certificates.
